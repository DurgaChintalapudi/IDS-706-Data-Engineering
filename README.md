## API Documentation
This project uses ```FastAPI``` to build REST APIs.<br/>
To run the API, please use the below command
```

```

## CLI 
This project uses ```click``` to build a CLI interface from which users can execute queries. Use the following command.

```
./query.py cli-query
```

or

```
./query.py cli-query <--query QUERYTEXT>
```


Then visit the prompted URL, and you will see a welcome message. Attach ```/query``` to the end of the URL. You will see the query result.
