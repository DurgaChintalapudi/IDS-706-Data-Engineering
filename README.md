```

## API Documentation
This project uses ```FastAPI``` to build REST APIs.<br/>


## CLI 
This project uses ```click``` to build a CLI interface from which users can execute queries. Use the following command.

```
./query.py cli-query
```

or

```
./query.py cli-query <--query QUERYTEXT>
```

## FastAPI inferface
This project also uses ```FastAPI``` to build a microservice that enables users to query in a RESTful way. Use the following command to start the service.

```
./app.py
```

Then visit the prompted URL, and you will see a welcome message. Attach ```/query``` to the end of the URL. You will see the query result.
